This is a developer tool that creates a clean ZIP file of a theme.

== Description ==

This is a WordPress plugin for Theme development.
It will create a *Theme Tools* admin page in the *Tools* section and you will be able to create a clean ZIP file for any of your themes, ready to be pblished to WP.org

By clean I mean it will get rid of all junk / hidden files like '.DS_Store', Git related files, etc. You can decide to keep SASS files or not.

Basically, it will prepare your theme to be uploaded to WordPress directory or a server to be downloaded and ready to be used.

Of course, you will still need to use Theme Check plugin and other tools. This will only allow you to generate a clean zip file of your theme. Nothing more.

== Installation ==

If you need help here, you should not use this plugin.
